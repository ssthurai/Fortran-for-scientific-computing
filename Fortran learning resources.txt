There are many different sources and online courses to learn C++ and Python (for scientific computing). 
However, it seems to me that Fortran is the code which is widely used in scientific codes, and standard resource to 
lean Fortran is less. 

Here, I list a number of useful Fortran resources which I am using to learn Fortran coding.

Here is the link for pages, articles, websites, books, etc.
